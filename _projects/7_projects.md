I designed and developed a custom PCB for my school’s Formula team, Olin Electric Motorsports, using KiCad to help with real-time vehicle debugging. The board reads CAN bus messages from the car’s network and displays key data on an LCD screen, giving the team an easy way to monitor system states and sensor values during testing and development. I handled the schematic design, PCB layout, and integration of the microcontroller, CAN transceiver, and display interface.
