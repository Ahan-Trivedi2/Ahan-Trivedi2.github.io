I designed and developed a custom PCB, using KiCad, to help with real-time vehicle debugging for my colleges FSAE team. The board reads CAN bus messages from the car’s network and displays key data on an LCD screen, giving the team an easy way to monitor system states and sensor values during testing and development.
