Four of my friends and I designed a self-balancing cube inspired by the [Cubli](https://www.wevolver.com/specs/cubli). Our team built a cube capable of balancing on a single edge by using an internal flywheel and a real-time feedback system to actively maintain stability. My primary focus was on the firmware and electrical integration: I developed the embedded control code that reads sensor data and drives the motors to maintain balance, and I integrated the supporting electrical hardware to power and interface the sensors, microcontroller, and actuators with the rest of the system. This work involved tuning feedback loops and managing real-time communication between components. You can check out my team’s journey and more details on the project at the website link at the top of the page.
