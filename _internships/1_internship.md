Modern artificial intelligence and high-performance computing workloads are increasingly constrained not by compute, but by memory. As model sizes and parameter counts continue to scale, both training and inference are limited by memory bandwidth, latency, and energy efficiency rather than raw processing power. To address this bottleneck, [high-bandwidth memory (HBM)](http://youtube.com/watch?v=bzwPZD1w7UY), which vertically stacks DRAM dies and interfaces closely with logic, has become a critical enabler for modern accelerators. 

As a Process Integration Engineering Intern in the Advanced Packaging Technology Development (APTD) group at Micron, I worked on research and development for advanced [wafer-level packaging technologies](https://anysilicon.com/understanding-wafer-level-packaging/) for next-generation HBM products. I specifically focused on optimizing the [fusion bonding](https://www.evgroup.com/technologies/fusion-and-hybrid-bonding) process at the wafer-to-wafer interface to improve bond strength, dielectric performance, and signal integrity. By the end of my summer internship, I had identified a bonding film with roughly 20% higher bond energy, gained experience with wafer-level process integration and industry metrology techniques, and developed automation and modeling software to support research and development.
