[Velo3D](https://velo3d.com/) builds metal additive manufacturing systems used to produce complex, high-performance parts for aerospace and industrial applications. As a Product Engineering Intern at Velo3D, I worked hands-on with manufacturing and hardware teams to improve the reliability of laser powder bed fusion printers. I helped refine manufacturing and print processes that reduced print failure rates, built and tested custom monitoring circuits to track voltage and temperature within the printer, and supported day-to-day debugging of electrical issues affecting the laser and optical subsystems.
