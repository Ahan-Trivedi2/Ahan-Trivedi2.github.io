Welcome to my portfolio! Here's an overview of who I am academically and professionally.

  - I have experience in circuit design, software development, and semiconductors.

  - I spent last summer (May–August 2025) at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com) working on heterogeneous integration approaches for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) targeting AI workloads.

  - I conduct research under [Dr. Georgia Van de Zande](https://www.olin.edu/bios/georgia-van-de-zande) at Olin College, focusing on design computation and natural language processing.

<strong>This portfolio highlights my resume, projects, research publications, and teaching experience.</strong>
