I am a Course Assistant for [Quantitative Engineering Analysis I](https://olin.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2021-22/catalog/courses-credits-hours/engr-engineering/2000/engx2000) at Olin College of Engineering, an applied linear algebra course focused on using mathematical tools to solve engineering problems. I spend most of my time helping students understand core linear algebra concepts, vector arithmetic, and how these ideas translate into engineering and mathematical models. I work closely with students as they build, analyze, and debug models in MATLAB, including setting up machine learning models, working with vectors and matrices, and interpreting computational results in an engineering context.
